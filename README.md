For now, don’t assign anything to Silver or Gold, just keep a list of items in Icebox and insert/prioritize them later

Bronze == MVP
1. User Stories
    1. RO / Views / GET
        1. I want a list of all stallion
        2. I want a list of all mares

MVP ... Studbook   aka   The Breeders' App.  README.md
1. Ember on Rails, to build upon Studbook already
2. Leave any API, like BetFair, to later if ever
3. Stick with Horse-Breeding, StudBook, not BookieBook
4. https://emberigniter.com/modern-bridge-ember-and-rails-5-with-json-api/
5. Use
    1. only HOF HIGHER_ORDER functions in the app
    2. JQUERY
    3. Start in es5, maybe grow it to es6
    4. api
    5. Later much later prolly never, replace ruby/ember f/e with react
    6. Flexbox


Address these Foci:
1. Secy.   oAuth.  Devise.

Video script:
Hi guys
My app is MVP for a horse rescue organization.  
It has 3 phases MVP, Silver & Gold are based on User Stories:
1. Rescue
2. Breed
3. Bet
Since all rescue is local we can do this with our own dataset.  Breeding crosses state lines and will have an API to EquiBase which has a century of data, it’s like a Genealogy.com for horses.  Betting is a whole new world.  Our version will be virtual races using Bayesian Analysis, similar to Drone Pilots sitting in a dark room or wind-tunnel testing for formula 1 race cars, and will require an API into RaceStats, a data service akin to EquiBase.

In this app I used all of our tools up through Rails.  
In future versions I’d like to get Devise in place to establish user roles, authentication and authorizations.

In this early stage, Zeta version, I did have fun setting a tone and voice that sounds like a cross between a bow-legged cowboy and one of the insanely, me-me-me children from Charlie & The Chocolate Factory.  Equestrian did however draw some lines and insisted on “no Mr Ed” images on the app.

Thanks for watching.

Jay
